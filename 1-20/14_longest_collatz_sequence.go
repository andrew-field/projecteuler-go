// My previous implementation kept track of how many sequences can be skipped because the starting number appeared in a previous sequence and hence the
// new sequence would be necessarily shorter. This was refactored to have a concurrent design and to make it simple/easy to read, though it no longer has this fine tuning
// and calculates every sequence. Still, the first half of all the sequences starting under 1'000'000 will appear as part of a longer sequence starting in the second half, so the first 50% can be skipped.
